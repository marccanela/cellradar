    "This notebook will focus on machine learning models. When using **Cell Radar** to identify the cells on a fluorescence image, it is essential to train a model to determine which segmentations correspond to cells and which do not. To achieve this objective, we will train a machine-learning classifier using a set of input images.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by importing the necessary packages for our analysis, including the functions from `cellradar`. Ensure you have correctly installed `cellradar` in your Conda environment following the instructions in [README.md](../README.md) and that you are running this notebook with this environment (top right corner of the notebook if you are using VSCode)."
