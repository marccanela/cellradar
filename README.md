# CellRadar ðŸ“¡ðŸ”¬

## Why this package?

**Cell Radar** is a Python package designed to analyze cells in fluorescent images. It provides tools for image segmentation based on [StarDist](https://github.com/stardist/stardist), model training based and prediction based on [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and colocalization analysis, tailored for complex experiments involving multiple fluorescent markers.

## Installation

To install **Cell Radar**, you can clone the repository and install it using `pip`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marccanela/cellradar.git
cd cellradar
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ cellradar==0.1.0
```

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can find them in `pyproject.toml`.
